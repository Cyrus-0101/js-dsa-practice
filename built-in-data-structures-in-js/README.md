# Objectives:
1. Understand how `objects` and `arrays` work, through the lens of Big "O"
1. Explain why adding elements to the beginning of an array is costly.
1. Compare and contrast runtime for arrays and objects, as well as built-in methods.

## Objects in JavaScript.
* They are unordered data structures, and everything is stored with key value pairs.

	### When to use objects:
	1. When you don't need order.
	1. When you need fast access/insertion and removal.
	
	## Big "O" of Objects:
		- Insertion - O(1)
		- Removal - O(1)
		- Searching - O(n)
		- Access - O(1)

* When you do not need any ordering, objects are an excellent choice.
